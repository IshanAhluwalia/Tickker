# Groups Page Fix for Supabase Migration

The issue is that the groups page is calling `groupApi.details()` which uses complex Supabase joins that are failing due to RLS policies. The specific error is a 500 status when trying to fetch group details with nested member and profile data.

## Root Cause
- Frontend trying to do complex join: `groups -> group_members -> profiles`  
- RLS policies not allowing the complex nested query
- The error occurs in `groupApi.details(g.id)` call

## Solution Applied
1. Replaced the complex `Promise.all` approach with a simpler sequential approach
2. Made the UI show basic group data first, then enhance it progressively 
3. Added proper error handling for each API call
4. Removed dependency on `groupApi.details()` which was causing the 500 error

## Changes Made
- Modified the `loadGroups()` function in `/frontend/app/groups/page.tsx`
- Changed from `Promise.all` to sequential enhancement
- Added error logging and graceful fallbacks
- Users will see groups load immediately with basic data, then enhanced details load

This approach ensures the groups page loads successfully even if some API calls fail.
